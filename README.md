# react-crypto-tracker

**react-crypto-tracker** is a website similair to CoinGecko where it tracks the cryptocurrency market and displaying varying types of cryptocurrencies, tracking their price changes, and the market cap of those cryptocurrencies. Uses the CoinGecko data market API to get data and analysis of the digital currency market. This is for me to get practice using React and APIs.

Time spent: **4** days spent in total

## Functionality
Using the CoinGecko data market I built a simplier version of CoinGecko cryptocurrency tracker. It displays the icon, name, and the ticker symbol of the different cryptocurrencies. Next to that info it displays the price, volume, price changes, and  market cap for that cryptocurrency. The price change is represented with percentages so when it drops down the text color is red and when it increases the text color changes to green. There is search bar the top so when the user want to look for a specific cryptocurrency the user can do that. The original CoinGecko site the user would have to left-click their mousse and click reload to refresh the page to see the changes that are happening to the cryptocurrency market. For more ease I added a Refresh button under the search bar so the user can just click that so see updates on the cryptocurrency market.
